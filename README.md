# AAAAAA

Welcome to the product of the worst panic attack(s) of my life!

You are Bis-san, a lowly test subject trying to find his custody papers in a mysterious abandoned lab... good thing you have gravity powers!

All criteria are fulfilled:

**Menu**: Got it. Very simple.

**Gameplay**: It *is* possible to speedrun the game to sub 2-min, but with the tutorial + an initial blind runthrough, it should be enough 'bite-sized' gameplay.

**Moving AI**: 5 instances, across the first 2 levels. They float to the top when a player gets close...

**Win/Lose**: Reach the end of Level 3 (4?) to get your custody papers! Run out of time to take the L.

**Shader**: The terrain turns red when you run out of time.

**Audio**: BGM for all levels, sound effects for dying/swapping gravity. The 3rd effect is a special one in the tutorial :)

**Extra Credit**: not attempted lol
